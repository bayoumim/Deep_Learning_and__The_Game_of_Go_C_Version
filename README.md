# Disclaimer

This is not one-to-one nor a complete implementation of the code book. I tried to be as accurate as possible and stick with the book's implementatin, but I did some changes to make the code run better or check the validity of my code. So, you will find (occassionaly) some differences between Python and C++ implementation
